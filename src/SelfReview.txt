What do you wish you had done differently in your design/implementation? Did you learn any lessons
 from the code given to you, or the updates you had to make for your customers?

 I wish we had done more planning on extensibility, we focused a lot more on getting the present
 version of our code working with some extensibility in mind. I think we did plan out reasonably
 and avoided major refactors, with last assignment it went a little haywire because we
 didn't have any existing infrastructure to build off of and that reflected a bit in this hw.

 The code from our providers showed us the different routes we could have gone with our code, we
 also learned that a lot of times with providers its luck based. We were fortunate to have providers
 with similar design structure to ours, which is why the differences they had were cool to see
 because we could have gone in that route and achieved a similar effect. We didn't need any updates
 from our providers everything worked the fist time around thankfully.

 Our customers were also very accomodating, they only needed one small fix and apart from that they
 were all set. The fix that they required however, taught me about the importance of abstraction
 and interface. Because we used a concrete class in our view they weren't able to access we had to
 rewrite some lines to abstract our view and make it rely on interfaces rather than concrete classes

 What was your experience like with your providers?

 Very positive experience since we didn't have to contact them at all apart from the intial code
 handoff. Based on our peers' experience we were very fortunate to have a smooth experience so we
 are grateful that they had design choices similar to ours.
